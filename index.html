        <p> Hello, I'm Jean Loor, student of BYU Idaho. I welcome you to my first job on a website.
            I am very excited to learn more and develop new skills as a software developer.
            To get to know me, you can see my presentation. I am from Ecuador, I am 21 years old, and I really
            like football,
            I love to play it and watch it. I also love technology.</p>
